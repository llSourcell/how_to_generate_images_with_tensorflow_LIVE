# how_to_generate_images_with_tensorflow_LIVE

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz-TZOEKXzA) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of the Deep Learning Nanodegree with Udacity. We're going to build a variational autoencoder that generates [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) digits after training on them. We could extend the code to generate any type of image, just replace the training data with your choice of dataset.

## Dependencies

* tensorflow
* numpy

## Usage

Run `jupyter notebook` in temrinal and the code will appear in the browser

Install jupyter [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
